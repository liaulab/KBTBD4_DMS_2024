# KBTBD4_DMS_2024
Repository containing code used to analyze DMS data in [KBTBD4 Cancer Hotspot Mutations Drive Neomorphic Degradation of HDAC1/2 Corepressor Complexes] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.14.593970v1.full). Correspondence to Brian B. Liau (liau@chemistry.harvard.edu).


## Repository Contents
1. Code to analyze DMS on KBTBD4 2b-2c loop: script to process and normalize variant counts from fastqs, resulting in values used in the paper (analyze_DMS_data.ipynb)
2. Code to generate position weight matrix: script to analyze DMS data and plot using logomaker (analyze_PWM.ipynb)

## Code to analyze DMS on KBTBD4 2b-2c loop: analyze_DMS_data.ipynb
- Conventions for names were hardcoded into the script, as well as search keys for variant counting.
- This code is modified from [in-house sgRNA counting script] (https://github.com/liaulab/DNMT1_eLife_2022/blob/main/Figure%201/DNMT1_Figure1_screen_analysis_functions.py)

## Code to generate position weight matrix: analyze_PWM.ipynb
- This script takes counts generated by analyze_DMS_data.ipynb and constructs a probability matrix. Information content is calculated using unsorted counts as background.
